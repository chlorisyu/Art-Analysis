0,MOMA,Rosa Barba: The Ocean of One's Pause,03/05/2025,Rosa Barba,Germany,"For Rosa Barba, cinema “allows time and space to vibrate, collapse, overlap, and extend.” Barba’s work often explores natural landscapes and human-made changes to the environment by delving into historical records, personal narratives, and the sensory experience of film. This installation brings together 15 years of Barba’s work, featuring film, kinetic sculpture, and sound. A newly commissioned 35mm film, Charge, forms the core of the installation and examines light as a source of ecological change and scientific innovation.

Accompanying these works is a series of live performances that will culminate in a presentation of White Museum, in which a stream of clear or “white” film will project from the Kravis Studio’s 53rd Street window onto the adjacent public plaza. White Museum transforms the exhibition space into a projection booth, the Museum into a cinematic device, and the plaza into a three-dimensional screen visible from within the building and from the street.",environmentalism,"Rosa Barba explores the impact of human activity on natural landscapes, specifically examining light as a source of both ecological change and scientific innovation.  She aims to reveal the complex interplay between natural processes and human intervention.","Barba consistently uses film, sculpture, and sound installations to explore themes of landscape, time, and perception. Her work often delves into historical records and personal narratives to contextualize environmental changes.  She has gained recognition through exhibitions at prominent institutions and her work has been well-received by critics for its poetic and thought-provoking approach to environmental issues.","Born in Germany and now based in Berlin, Barba's work may be influenced by Europe's historical engagement with both industrial development and environmental awareness. Her focus on light could stem from its dual role in both natural ecosystems and technological advancements.","In 'Charge' (2025), a 35mm film central to 'The Ocean of One's Pause', Barba examines the effects of artificial light on both the environment and scientific research. The film uses long exposures and manipulated imagery to highlight the intersection of natural phenomena and human interventions. This work has been praised for its ability to evoke a sense of wonder and concern about the ecological consequences of technological progress."
1,MOMA,Nour Mobarak: Dafne Phono,26/10/2024,Nour Mobarak,Lebanon,"For her first museum exhibition in New York City, Lebanese American artist Nour Mobarak presents a large-scale installation reinterpreting the first opera, La Dafne, which was staged by Jacopo Peri and Ottavio Rinuccini in 1598 and inspired by Ovid’s myth of Apollo and Daphne. In Mobarak’s reimagining of La Dafne, 15 singing sculptures—encasing a multichannel sound installation within mycelium structures—recount the tale in some of the world’s most phonetically complex languages.

Building on histories of avant-garde sound, Mobarak’s most ambitious work to date draws on a longstanding interest in mechanized voice and memory across her practice, which ranges from sculpture to performance, moving image, poetry, and music. In Dafne Phono, Mobarak draws analogies between linguistic structure and the biological processes of mycelium, exploring how both are governed by systems of repetition, decomposition, and regeneration, and relate to wider forces of political power. Bringing new perspectives to a key antecedent in the history of performance, Dafne Phono joins nature and technology in an exploration of the voice’s ability to endure cycles of life and death, bridging histories both ancient and present.",memory_and_identity,"Nour Mobarak, in her work 'Dafne Phono,' explores the intersection of language, memory, and cultural heritage. By reinterpreting the first opera, 'La Dafne,' through singing sculptures encased in mycelium structures, she examines how language, particularly phonetically complex ones, acts as a vessel for transmitting and preserving cultural narratives across time. The mycelium structures, with their processes of repetition, decomposition, and regeneration, further symbolize the cyclical nature of cultural memory and its continuous evolution.","Mobarak's artistic practice spans various mediums, including sculpture, performance, moving image, poetry, and music, consistently demonstrating an interest in mechanized voice and memory.  'Dafne Phono' represents a culmination of her exploration of these themes, showcasing her innovative approach to storytelling and her engagement with historical narratives. Her work has been recognized by institutions like the Museum of Modern Art, indicating a growing appreciation for her unique artistic vision within the art world.","As a Lebanese American artist, Mobarak's personal background likely informs her interest in cultural heritage and the transmission of traditions. Her dual identity may contribute to a nuanced perspective on the complexities of preserving cultural memory in a globalized world.  Her choice to use phonetically complex languages might also reflect a desire to highlight the diversity and richness of human expression.","While 'Dafne Phono' itself is a large-scale installation, other works by Mobarak demonstrate her engagement with similar themes.  For example, her performance pieces often incorporate elements of sound and voice, exploring the ways in which these elements can evoke memory and emotion.  Her use of mycelium structures, which are both natural and technological, also reflects her interest in the intersection of nature, technology, and human experience.  This multidisciplinary approach allows her to address complex themes in a compelling and accessible way."

3,MOMA,Life Dances On. Robert Frank in Dialogue,15/09/2024,Robert Frank,Switzerland,"“I think of myself, standing in a world that is never standing still,” the artist Robert Frank once wrote. “I’m still in there fighting, alive because I believe in what I’m trying to do now.” Life Dances On: Robert Frank in Dialogue—the artist’s first solo exhibition at MoMA—provides a new perspective on his expansive body of work by exploring the six vibrant decades of Frank’s career following the 1958 publication of his landmark photobook, The Americans.

Coinciding with the centennial of Frank’s birth, the exhibition will explore his restless experimentation across mediums including photography, film, and books, as well as his dialogues with other artists and his communities. It will include some 200 works made over 60 years until the artist’s death in 2019, many drawn from MoMA’s extensive collection, as well as materials that have never before been exhibited.

The exhibition borrows its title from Frank’s poignant 1980 film, in which the artist reflects on the individuals who have shaped his outlook. Like much of his work, the film is set in New York City and Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, where he and his wife, the artist June Leaf, moved in 1969. In the film, Leaf looks at the camera and asks Frank, “Why do you make these pictures?” In an introduction to the film’s screening, he answered: “Because I am alive.”",memory_and_identity,"Robert Frank reflects on his life and career, exploring themes of personal experience, artistic process, and the passage of time. He emphasizes the importance of continuous engagement with the world and the ongoing struggle to create meaningful work.","Frank's career spans photography, film, and bookmaking, often blurring the lines between documentary and personal expression.

His work has been highly influential in the development of documentary photography and independent filmmaking, and he has received widespread critical acclaim and institutional recognition.","Born in Switzerland and later based in the United States, Frank's work may be influenced by his experience of displacement and his observation of American culture.  His focus on personal experience and the passage of time could stem from his own life journey and his reflections on mortality.","In 'Life Dances On' (1980), Frank uses film to reflect on his life, his artistic process, and the individuals who have shaped his outlook. The film's focus on New York City and Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, reflects the importance of place and community in his work.  This film has been celebrated for its intimate and honest portrayal of the artist's life and creative struggles."
4,MOMA,Alex Katz: Seasons,04/07/2024,"	Alex Katz",United States,"The four monumental paintings featured in Alex Katz: Seasons chronicle the changing of the seasons, from the vibrant colors of spring, summer, and fall to the stark palette of winter. These works belong to a new suite of more than 100 paintings created by Alex Katz in his New York studio since 2022. The artist draws inspiration from his immediate surroundings, whether a lone tree encountered on Houston Street on the way home from the cinema, or the lush landscape of Maine, where Katz has spent his summers since 1954. “The sensation of color is what I wanted,” he says. “It’s the sensation of seeing.”

Alex Katz: Seasons celebrates the artist’s ever-evolving approach to interpreting the natural world. He often begins with photographs, taken with an iPhone, and smaller painted sketches, which he transforms into large-scale compositions. In many instances, Katz removes the horizon; its absence, paired with the paintings’ large scale, creates an environment with no clear beginning or end. Katz frequently completes an entire painting in a single morning. Despite continuously revisiting and reworking the four seasons theme, he approaches each canvas as a new venture. Katz cheerfully describes his process as, “Hold your breath and hope for the best.”",perception_and_experience,Alex Katz explores the changing seasons through a focus on color and sensory experience. He aims to capture the sensation of seeing and the immediate impact of the natural world on his perception.,"Katz has consistently focused on portraiture and landscape painting, developing a distinctive style characterized by flatness, bold colors, and simplified forms.  'Seasons' represents a continuation of his long-term engagement with the natural world and his ongoing exploration of perception.  He has achieved significant recognition within the art world, with his work being featured in major museums and galleries.  His work has been both praised for its innovative approach to figuration and criticized for its perceived superficiality.","Based in New York City and spending summers in Maine, Katz's work is deeply connected to his immediate surroundings.  His focus on the changing seasons reflects his close observation of nature and his interest in capturing fleeting moments of sensory experience.","In the 'Seasons' series, Katz's large-scale paintings of spring, summer, fall, and winter capture the vibrant colors and distinct moods of each season. By removing the horizon in some works, he creates a sense of immediacy and immersion, inviting viewers to directly experience the sensation of color.  These paintings have been commended for their ability to evoke the emotional and aesthetic power of the natural world."

He seeks to convey the emotional and psychological impact of displacement and the persistent presence of memory, particularly as it relates to physical spaces. His translucent fabric sculptures evoke a sense of fragility and impermanence, reflecting the transient nature of both physical dwellings and personal experiences.","Throughout his career, Suh has consistently investigated the themes of home, displacement, and cultural identity through his ethereal fabric installations. He often replicates his own living spaces, creating ghostly, translucent versions that symbolize the intangible aspects of memory and belonging.  His work has been widely exhibited in major museums and galleries worldwide, garnering critical acclaim for its poignant exploration of personal and collective experiences of migration and cultural hybridity. Institutions like the Tate Modern, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Smithsonian have recognized the significance of his work in addressing contemporary issues of globalization and cultural exchange.","Suh's personal experience of moving from Korea to the West has deeply influenced his artistic practice. His work reflects his own feelings of displacement and the challenges of navigating multiple cultural identities.

An artist, performer, model, TV personality, club promoter, fashion designer and musician, Bowery took on many different roles, all the while refusing to be limited by convention. From his emergence in the nightlife of 1980s London through to his later daring and outrageous performances in galleries, theatres, and the street, Bowery fearlessly forged his own vibrant path. He reimagined clothing and makeup as forms of painting and sculpture, tested the limits of decorum, and celebrated the body as a shape-shifting tool with the power to challenge norms of aesthetics, sexuality and gender. Embracing performance, club culture and fashion design, Bowery created some of the most iconic images of the 1980s and 90s that continue to resonate, with his influence seen in the work of figures such as Alexander McQueen, Jeffrey Gibson, Anohni, and Lady Gaga.

He aims to create an immersive environment where viewers become active participants, engaging their senses of sight, touch, and movement as they navigate through projected forms of 'solid light.' His installations challenge traditional notions of sculpture and cinema, blurring the lines between the two and creating a unique sensory encounter.","McCall's career has been marked by a consistent exploration of light as a sculptural medium. His early film works in the 1970s laid the groundwork for his 'solid-light' installations, which gained recognition in the 1990s and 2000s.  Galleries and institutions have embraced his innovative approach, showcasing his work in major exhibitions worldwide.  His work has been influential in expanding the definition of sculpture and installation art.","McCall's motivation likely stems from a desire to create art that transcends traditional boundaries and engages viewers on a deeper, more experiential level.  His background in experimental filmmaking and his interest in minimalism inform his artistic practice. His nationality and current residence may not be direct factors in his choice of subject matter, but the broader cultural context of contemporary art's focus on sensory experience and audience engagement likely plays a role.","A prime example of McCall's work is 'Line Describing a Cone' (1973). In this piece, a volumetric cone of light is projected in a darkened room. As viewers move through the space, they interact with the light, disrupting its form and casting their own shadows.  The artwork achieves its thematic focus by transforming light, an intangible phenomenon, into a tangible, three-dimensional presence that viewers can physically experience.  This direct engagement with light and space heightens the viewer's awareness of their own perception and bodily presence within the artwork."

Muholi describes themself as a visual activist. From the early 2000s, they have documented and celebrated the lives of South Africa’s Black lesbian, gay, trans, queer and intersex communities.

In the early series Only Half the Picture, Muholi captures moments of love and intimacy as well as intense images alluding to traumatic events – despite the equality promised by South Africa’s 1996 constitution, its LGBTQIA+ community remains a target for violence and prejudice.

In Faces and Phases each participant looks directly at the camera, challenging the viewer to hold their gaze. These images and the accompanying testimonies form a growing archive of a community of people who are risking their lives by living authentically in the face of oppression and discrimination.

Other key series of works, include Brave Beauties, which celebrates empowered non-binary people and trans women, many of whom have won Miss Gay Beauty pageants, and Being, a series of tender images of couples which challenge stereotypes and taboos.

Muholi turns the camera on themself in the ongoing series Somnyama Ngonyama – translated as ‘Hail the Dark Lioness’. These powerful and reflective images explore themes including labour, racism, Eurocentrism and sexual politics.​

He believed that color held symbolic meaning and could evoke specific feelings and states of mind.  Animals were frequent subjects, representing a connection to a more primal and spiritual existence. His use of vibrant colors and abstract forms was a means to express a deeper, subjective experience of reality.","Throughout his career, Marc moved from a more representational style towards increasing abstraction, culminating in his iconic animal paintings characterized by bold colors and fragmented forms. His work, along with that of other Blue Rider artists, was initially met with resistance by traditional art institutions but gradually gained recognition as a pivotal force in the development of Expressionism and abstract art.  The Blue Rider group organized exhibitions and published almanacs, promoting their vision of art as a spiritual and emotional force.","Marc's artistic motivations were rooted in a desire for spiritual expression and a rejection of the materialistic values of his time.  The increasing industrialization and militarization of pre-World War I Germany likely contributed to his search for meaning in the natural world and the spiritual realm.  His personal experiences, including his connection to nature and his interest in theosophy, also influenced his artistic vision.","{'artwork_name': 'The Large Blue Horses (1911)', 'explanation': ""This painting exemplifies Marc's use of vibrant color and simplified forms to convey an emotional and spiritual interpretation of the natural world. The blue horses, rendered in dynamic curves and surrounded by a landscape of rolling hills and simplified trees, represent a sense of harmony and vitality. The painting's non-naturalistic colors and abstract elements move beyond mere representation, inviting viewers to engage with the work on an emotional and spiritual level.""}"

20,Gagosian Gallery,Setsuko: Kingdom of Cats,15/01/2025,Setsuko Klossowska de Rola,Japan,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Kingdom of Cats, an exhibition of works by Setsuko that represents the first time the artist has shown her bronze and ceramic sculptures in New York. The inclusion of paintings, works on paper, and handmade tables and pedestals offers a material overview of the artist’s practice. Opening on January 15, the presentation makes full use of the intimate space at Park & 75, and visitors will also be able to view it from the street.

In her sculptures, Setsuko renders natural subjects with rich, tactile surfaces, uniting organic and constructed elements to represent the symbiosis of life and death. In her gouache and watercolor paintings of still-life and floral arrangements, domestic interiors, and landscapes, she conveys the joy embodied in crafted objects, organic forms, and atmospheric spaces. Combining ancient Eastern traditions with twentieth-century Western ideas, Setsuko interprets the everyday in ways that are at once lyrical and precise.

As the exhibition’s title suggests, cats make repeated appearances in the works on view. The lively creatures, of which Setsuko has owned dozens, have cropped up frequently in the artist’s practice over the years, always conveying a sense of agency and animating the spaces through which they move. Cats are important symbols in Japanese folklore regarded as possessing special abilities; the classification kaibyō (“strange cat”) includes bakeneko, a yōkai or supernatural entity with the ability to shapeshift into human form. Maneki-neko, on the other hand, are usually depicted as waving figurines empowered to bring their owners good luck. Setsuko’s late husband, Balthus, also referred to himself as the “King of Cats.”

In the delicately modeled enameled ceramic and terra-cotta objects on view in New York, which include Le chaton et sa mère (2024), Le chat et l’arbre (2024), L’arbre et la chouette (2023), and Le serpent et la vigne (2024)—all produced at Astier de Villatte’s workshop in Paris—Setsuko represents plants and animals that have made trees their homes. Cats meander around gnarled roots while watchful owls perch in upper branches and snakes wind around imposing trunks. Inspired by Japanese Jōmon earthenware (c. 10,500–300 BCE), Setsuko also evokes the country’s animistic Shinto religion, to which trees are of central significance.

Trees and other plants are also the subjects of Setsuko’s hand-painted bronzes, which include a new large-scale representation of a fig tree with foliage and attendant animals, finished in a dark green patina. In Le chat et la vie (2024), the tree’s circular form embodies the cycle of life, a theme reinforced by the subject’s historical symbolic significance—fig trees are often referenced in antique and religious texts. In two other bronzes, Chandelier (le vigne) (2021) and Grand Chandelier (grenades) (2023), the natural organisms of the works’ titles are refigured as baroque candelabras. The artist also extends her use of terra-cotta in three rectangular palettes shaped from slabs of the material painted with scenes distinguished by a heady mix of classical, natural, and mystical imagery inspired by mythological characters such as Daphne and using color derived from dreams. Setsuko only began employing the highly physical processes necessary to the shaping of bronze and ceramic in 2019; thus, these projects constitute a significant new direction for an artist still eager to experiment with material and form.

The paintings on paper, canvas, and wood in Kingdom of Cats are mostly delicate still-life arrangements and domestic interiors. The earliest, Nature morte avec branches de kumquat, is from around 1960 and the most recent, Bouquet de printemps III, was completed in 2023. Paysage d’Italie (2023) is a landscape study representing the loggia of the artist’s former house at Montecalvello, near Rome. In compositions such as Nature morte avec l’oiseau bleu (2020) and the luminous gouache Nature morte sur tissues indiens (1993), Setsuko invests flattened pictorial spaces with a quiet intimacy, again synthesizing traditional Japanese and modernist European approaches.",memory_and_identity,"Setsuko Klossowska de Rola, through her focus on cats in her portraits, seems to be exploring her personal connection with these animals, potentially as a reflection of her own identity and experiences. The exhibition description highlights the continuity of this motif throughout her career, suggesting a long-term engagement with this theme. Her portraits of cats are not simply representations of animals, but rather an exploration of a personal connection and artistic development over time.  This aligns with the theme of memory and identity by examining the influence of personal experiences on her artistic expression and the development of a unique artistic identity.","Setsuko's artistic career, as described, reveals a consistent engagement with portraiture, initially focusing on family members and later expanding to cats. This shift, while maintaining the core element of portraiture, suggests an evolution in her artistic focus, potentially reflecting changing personal circumstances or a deepening exploration of her personal relationship with these animals. The fact that this is her first major New York exhibition since 1993 adds another layer to this narrative, possibly marking a significant point in her artistic journey and public presentation of this theme.  Her work has been recognized by major galleries like Gagosian, indicating an appreciation for her unique approach to portraiture and its connection to personal narratives.","Setsuko's personal life, particularly her relationship with her husband Balthus (a renowned artist himself) and their son, likely played a significant role in shaping her artistic focus on family and personal connections.  Her Japanese nationality and life in Switzerland may have further influenced her perspective, adding cultural nuances to her exploration of identity and memory through her art. Her long-term residence in Rossinière, a rural Swiss village, might have contributed to her close observation of animals and their integration into her artistic practice.","One example of Setsuko's work demonstrating this theme could be one of her cat portraits from the ""Kingdom of Cats"" exhibition.  Unfortunately, specific images of her cat portraits are not readily available online. However, her portraits are described as capturing the ""essence"" and ""unique spirit"" of cats through her understanding of animal anatomy, subtle use of color and light, and deep respect for her subjects. This approach transforms her portraits from mere representations into explorations of individual character and a personal connection with the animal, reflecting the theme of identity and personal experience. The act of portraiture itself, traditionally used to capture human likeness and personality, is applied to cats, blurring the lines between human and animal identity and suggesting a deeper connection between the artist and her subjects."
21,Gagosian Gallery,Takashi Murakami,20/12/2024,Takashi Murakami,Japan,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Japanese Art History à la Takashi Murakami, an exhibition of new paintings by Murakami at its Grosvenor Hill gallery in London. In this presentation, the artist pursues his fascination with the narrative of Japanese art by offering his own interpretations of historical paintings. By “Murakamizing” these iconic images, he ponders the erosion of the nation’s ancient splendor; he also considers the ways in which it has been impacted by new aesthetics and values associated with its opening to the West after the end of the Edo period (1603–1868). Rakuchū-Rakugai-zu Byōbu: Iwasa Matabei RIP (2023–24) is modeled on Iwasa Matabei’s Rakuchū-Rakugai-zu Byōbu (Scenes in and around Kyoto) (Funaki Version) from the collection of the Tokyo National Museum. The original seventeenth-century work depicts the city in extraordinary detail across two six-panel folding screens. Murakami’s version, which was commissioned for his exhibition Mononoke Kyoto at the Kyoto City Kyocera Museum of Art, populates its gold-leaf clouds with skulls, a memento mori inspired by a visit to the Toribeno burial ground. He also integrates examples of his own iconography including smiling flower-faced figures and his familiar Mr. DOB character.",memory_and_identity,"Murakami explores the complexities of contemporary visual culture, blending high and low art, Eastern and Western traditions, and ancient and modern imagery to create a unique artistic language. He examines how these elements intersect and influence the formation of cultural identity in a globalized world.","Throughout his career, Murakami has consistently engaged with themes of memory, identity, and cultural heritage. He draws inspiration from traditional Japanese art forms like Nihonga painting and ukiyo-e woodblock prints, while also incorporating elements of contemporary pop culture, anime, and manga.  Initially viewed as a provocative figure challenging traditional art boundaries, Murakami gained significant recognition from major galleries and institutions like the Gagosian Gallery and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, for his innovative approach to bridging Eastern and Western art practices. His work has been instrumental in expanding the understanding of contemporary art beyond Western perspectives.","Murakami's exploration of these themes is likely motivated by his personal experience growing up in postwar Japan, witnessing the country's rapid modernization and its complex relationship with its own cultural heritage.  His position as a Japanese artist working in a globalized art world allows him to offer a unique perspective on the intersection of different cultural influences.","Mr. DOB (1993) is an iconic early work by Murakami that embodies his exploration of memory and identity.  It's a self-portrait of sorts, referencing both Mickey Mouse and Japanese anime characters.  This playful yet complex image reflects Murakami's negotiation of Japanese cultural identity in the context of American cultural influence and the legacy of World War II.  The work's playful aesthetic also subverts traditional artistic hierarchies, bringing 'low' art forms into the realm of 'high' art, which is a recurring theme in Murakami's work and reflects his ongoing commentary on cultural hybridity."
22,Gagosian Gallery,Sarah Crowner: Night for Day,14/11/2024,Sarah Crowner,United States,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Night for Day, an exhibition of new works by Sarah Crowner. Opening on November 14 at the Athens gallery, the exhibition features new paintings and an immersive, site-specific tile installation.

A brilliant yellow hue permeates the gallery’s ground-floor spaces, emanating from a plane of handmade glazed tiles spanning in all directions. Laid in an expansive chevron pattern and set atop a raised wooden platform as if a theatrical stage, Platform (Yellow terra cotta) (2024) is immediately visible from the gallery’s entrance: visitors step onto a bright, earthen surface and into a chromatic environment that replicates the color temperature of the intense Hellenic heat, capturing daylight as one might enter the color field of an abstract painting.

In the upstairs rooms, sewn paintings composed of interlocking curvilinear shapes hang in contrast to the hard heat below. Deep greens and rich blues saturate soft surfaces and recall illuminated foliage of dense gardens or forests at night. Inverting the title of François Truffaut’s 1973 film Day for Night, which was named after the filmmaking technique in which outdoor sequences are filmed in daylight and filtered to appear as if at night, Crowner subtly catalyzes a sequence of light to dark and back again as one travels between gallery floors—a sensory palette that evolves as much between tangible forms as with shifts in natural light throughout the day.",perception_and_experience,"Sarah Crowner explores the interplay between fragmentation and wholeness, and how individual elements contribute to an overall perception. Her deconstructed and reassembled canvases invite viewers to actively engage in the process of constructing meaning from seemingly disparate parts, mirroring the way we assemble our understanding of the world from individual sensory experiences.","Crowner's artistic journey began with explorations of collage, evolving into her current method of painting on separate canvases, cutting them, and then reassembling them. This shift reflects a deeper engagement with the act of painting itself, while still referencing the improvisational and fragmented nature of collage.  This approach has garnered attention from prominent galleries like Gagosian, marking a significant step in her career.","As an American artist living and working in New York, a city characterized by its constant flux and fragmented experiences, Crowner's work may be influenced by her surroundings.  The bustling and diverse nature of the city, with its constant bombardment of information and sensory input, could inform her exploration of how we piece together our understanding of the world from fragmented experiences.","{'artwork_example': 'Penelope (2020)', 'explanation': ""In 'Penelope,' Crowner uses a combination of painted canvas and sewn-together sections of linen. The fragmented composition, with its varied colors and textures, encourages the viewer to actively participate in piecing together the work, both visually and conceptually.  The act of sewing, traditionally associated with domesticity and women's work, adds another layer to the work's exploration of construction and deconstruction.  This piece exemplifies Crowner's focus on perception and how we create meaning from disparate elements, reflecting the fragmented nature of experience itself.""}"
23,Gagosian Gallery,"Katharina Grosse: Pie Sell, Lee Slip, Eel Lips",12/11/2024,Katharina Grosse,Germany,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Pie Sell, Lee Slip, Eel Lips, an exhibition of new paintings by Katharina Grosse at its gallery at Park & 75, New York. This exhibition follows Katharina Grosse: Studio Paintings, 1988–2022: Returns, Revisions, Inventions, a retrospective that originated at the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum in Saint Louis and traveled to the Kunstmuseum Bern and Kunstmuseum Bonn through September 2024.

Grosse uses a compressor-driven spray gun to apply industrial paints directly onto landscapes, architecture, objects, and panels. This tool extends her reach and accelerates her gestures, balancing impulsiveness with intent. In her studio outside Berlin, she produces works on canvas in a practice that is consistent with the spontaneous flow of her improvisational, performative process. Painting in the studio also permits her to develop works over a longer period than the institutional and organizational constraints of her in-situ projects generally allow.

In her studio paintings as much as in her environmental works, Grosse uses paint to claim territory at immersive scales, introducing new conceptions of color and space that disorient and reorient the viewer. To make them, she sprays paint onto unstretched canvases in a varied palette of vibrant primary and secondary hues, making use of chromatic and spatial juxtaposition. The propulsive, rhythmic marks traverse the paintings as tapering lines and whiplash curves that spiral back on themselves, capturing the trajectories of the artist’s full-body movements.",perception_and_experience,"Katharina Grosse's work often explores the subjective experience of color and space. Her large-scale installations and paintings envelop the viewer, creating an immersive environment that challenges traditional notions of perception.  She uses vibrant, often unnaturalistic colors and unconventional methods of applying paint, such as spraying it directly onto surfaces, to heighten the sensory impact of her work and explore the boundaries between painting, sculpture, and architecture.","Throughout her career, Grosse has consistently pushed the boundaries of painting.  She began with more traditional canvases but gradually expanded her practice to encompass entire architectural spaces and natural landscapes.  Her work has been increasingly embraced by major galleries and institutions, with prominent exhibitions at the Venice Biennale, Mass MoCA, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.  These exhibitions have allowed her to explore the immersive potential of her work on a grand scale, blurring the lines between artwork and environment.","Grosse's focus on perception and experience might stem from her training in painting and her interest in challenging conventional artistic practices.  Her German background, with its rich history of abstract art and experimental approaches to materiality, likely played a role in shaping her artistic vision.  Her choice to work on a large scale and engage with diverse environments might reflect a desire to create art that transcends the confines of the traditional gallery space and directly impacts the viewer's sensory experience.","An example of Grosse's work demonstrating this theme is her 2018 installation at the National Gallery in Prague.  She transformed the gallery's historical architecture into a vibrant, immersive environment by spraying brightly colored paint directly onto the walls, floors, and even the trees outside the building.  This intervention disrupted the viewer's expectations of the gallery space and created a dynamic interplay between the artwork, the architecture, and the surrounding environment.  The sheer scale and intensity of the color created a powerful sensory experience, challenging viewers to reconsider their relationship to the space and their own perception of color and form."
24,Gagosian Gallery,Jeff Wall,08/11/2024,Jeff Wall,Canada,"Gagosian is pleased to present an exhibition of works by Jeff Wall at the 541 West 24th Street gallery in New York. Included are five new pictures and several not previously seen in the United States.

Wall connects photography with elements of painting, cinema, and literature in pictures that range from classic reportage to elaborate constructions. Some images emphasize what the artist calls “blatant artifice,” while others are made simply, spontaneously, and directly. Wall favors no particular approach and has explored the breadth and complexity of photography for several decades.

A number of works in the exhibition are what Wall calls “near documentary” images, which may resemble snapshots but are made in collaboration with people who appear in them. This group includes two full-length portraits, Young man wet with rain (2011) and Portrait in Noto, which was photographed in 2007 during a visit to Sicily, but printed only this year. Fallen rider, made in summer 2022, derives from an event witnessed by a friend thirty years ago; Wall recovered the memory of this account and reconstructed it near the place where it apparently occurred.",perception_and_experience,"Jeff Wall's photographs often depict seemingly everyday scenes, but with a heightened sense of reality and detail. He aims to capture the complexities of human experience and the ways in which we perceive and interact with the world around us. He uses photography to create highly detailed and staged images that explore the nature of perception, reality, and representation itself.  The 'new and recent' aspect of the exhibition suggests a continuation of his exploration of these themes, likely with new perspectives and techniques.","Throughout his career, Wall has consistently challenged the boundaries of photography, moving beyond documentary and snapshot aesthetics to create large-scale, meticulously composed images that resemble cinematic stills.  He has been highly influential in the art world, with his work being exhibited in major museums and galleries internationally. His work has helped elevate photography to the status of fine art and has influenced generations of artists. He's been embraced by major galleries like Gagosian, indicating a strong market and critical recognition for his work.","Wall's Canadian background and his academic training in art history have likely influenced his conceptual approach to photography. His work often reflects a detached, analytical observation of the world, which could be attributed to his academic background. While not directly related to his nationality, his location in Canada may provide a unique perspective on themes of nature and urban environments, often present in his works.","A picture for Women (1979). In this work, Wall recreates a scene inspired by Manet's ""A Bar at the Folies-Bergère."" By meticulously staging the scene and using a large-format camera, Wall creates a hyperreal image that invites viewers to question the nature of representation and the relationship between photography, painting, and reality. The large scale and detail enhance the viewer's experience, prompting reflection on their own act of looking and interpreting."
25,Gagosian Gallery,Sabine Moritz: Frost,08/11/2024,Sabine Moritz,Germany,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Frost, an exhibition of new abstract paintings by Sabine Moritz. This is the artist’s second exhibition with the gallery and her first on the West Coast.

Moritz’s paintings, drawings, and prints envision moments suspended in time. In her earlier work, the artist juxtaposes interpretations of her immediate surroundings and signifiers of the natural world with deconstructed documentary images; in many of her recent canvases, she adopts a more narrative approach, which she augments by using a horizontal format. Continually altering and deploying a wide range of abstract and symbolic motifs, Moritz explores the dynamics of transience and decay in works that locate personal experiences within broadly shared histories.

Since 2015, Moritz has increasingly worked in an abstract mode, creating paintings that she dubs “psychological landscapes,” titled after elements, locations, months, seasons, and mythological entities. In these works, overlapping brushstrokes are allied with chromatic contrasts in improvised compositions. Searching for primal sensory experience, Moritz avoids preliminary sketching, confronting the viewer instead with an unmediated dialogue between color and gesture that addresses recollection and history in a consciously oblique, ambiguous manner.

In the twenty new canvases on view in Beverly Hills, Moritz presents dense arrays of painterly marks that harness the emotional power of color while retaining a consistent visual rhythm. With titles that refer to time and place, and to poetry—And the lovers lie abed, with all their griefs in their arms (D. T.) (2024) is taken from Dylan Thomas’s ars poetica “In My Craft or Sullen Art,” from his 1946 collection Deaths and Entrances—the works repay extended looking. Moritz applies pigment vigorously and in layers, sometimes as impasto, which is then scraped back to imbue the surface with a varied texture. Engineering collisions between shape and hue, she sometimes also suggests figures emerging from or disappearing into the works’ interlocking patterns. This establishes references to artists of different epochs who have integrated the human form into landscape paintings. Like frost, which seems suspended between liquid and solid conditions, Moritz’s figures exist in an enigmatic liminal state.",perception_and_experience,"Sabine Moritz's work often explores the subjective experience of landscapes and urban environments, focusing on the interplay of light, color, and atmosphere to evoke specific moods and sensations. In 'Frost,' she likely explores the perceptual shift in how we experience familiar surroundings transformed by winter's touch.","Throughout her career, Moritz has been known for her evocative paintings and drawings that capture the transient qualities of light and atmosphere.  She has been exhibited in prominent galleries and museums internationally, garnering critical acclaim for her ability to create emotionally resonant images of place.  Her work resonates with the broader trend in contemporary art towards exploring subjective experience and the phenomenology of perception.","Born in East Germany, Moritz's experiences of living through political and social transitions likely inform her interest in capturing the ephemeral nature of reality and the subjective experience of change. Her focus on perception could be seen as a way of grappling with the shifting landscapes of memory and identity in a rapidly changing world.  Living and working in Cologne, Germany, provides her with a specific urban and natural environment that inspires her artistic explorations.","One example of Moritz's work that demonstrates her focus on perception is her painting 'Stadtbild mit gelbem Haus' (Cityscape with Yellow House). In this work, the interplay of light and shadow, the simplified forms of buildings, and the vibrant yellow of the house create a sense of both immediacy and dreamlike detachment, capturing a specific moment of perceived experience within an urban environment."

—Jadé Fadojutimi

Gagosian is pleased to announce DWELVE: A Goosebump in Memory, Jadé Fadojutimi’s first solo exhibition in New York, at 522 West 21st Street. Featuring new paintings and works on paper, the project bears a title that combines the words dwell and delve, suggesting both domestic familiarity and sites that prompt further discovery.

In her large-scale acrylic and oil canvases, Fadojutimi uses color, space, and line to explore concepts of identity, emotion, and experience. Employing layers and gestural marks, she produces compositions that often suggest plants or landscapes, but which ultimately remain abstract. Each visual “environment” is constructed with strata of paint interrupted by lines of oil pastel and oil bar, the indeterminate contours of which suggest narratives of displacement. Fadojutimi also draws inspiration from animation, clothing, and music.",memory_and_identity,"Fadojutimi explores the interplay of memory, identity, and place. Her work delves into how our experiences shape our sense of self and how our surroundings, both physical and virtual, influence our understanding of who we are.","Throughout her career, Fadojutimi has consistently investigated these themes through large-scale, immersive paintings characterized by vibrant colors and dynamic brushwork.  She has been recognized by major galleries and institutions for her innovative approach to abstraction and her ability to evoke complex emotional and psychological states through her work. Her work has been featured in solo and group exhibitions at prominent venues, solidifying her position as a significant contemporary artist.","Born in 1991, Fadojutimi's exploration of identity may be influenced by her experiences as a young artist navigating a rapidly changing world.  As a British artist with Nigerian heritage, her work could also reflect on the complexities of cultural identity and belonging in a globalized society.","An example of her work demonstrating this theme is 'Jesture' (2020).  This large-scale painting features a vibrant, swirling composition of colors and forms that evoke a sense of movement and flux. The dynamic brushstrokes and layered hues suggest the fluidity of memory and the ever-shifting nature of identity.  The painting's abstract nature allows viewers to project their own experiences and interpretations onto the canvas, inviting them to engage with the themes of memory and identity in a personal and meaningful way."

Basquiat saw the world differently. He had a great grasp of the history of art and visual culture and was brilliant at bringing the past to life in his paintings. His work reminds us of the common chords and resonances of beauty and identity throughout art history. Seeing his painting in dialogue with this ancient Venus sculpture reminds us of the enduring energy and sophistication of his work.
—Larry Gagosian

Gagosian is pleased to announce Venus, a pairing of two rarely seen masterpieces from different millennia: Untitled (1982), a significant painting from Jean-Michel Basquiat’s acclaimed Modena series, is shown in dialogue with an Imperial Roman sculpture of the goddess Venus loaned from the Torlonia Collection in Rome, the world’s largest private collection of Roman art. This is Gagosian’s eleventh exhibition dedicated to Basquiat and demonstrates the gallery’s ongoing commitment to the artist’s legacy.

Highlighting how Venus has been a muse across centuries, the exhibition is on view from October 17 at Gagosian’s gallery at 9 rue de Castiglione and offers an uncommon gallery setting for classical and contemporary masterworks in central Paris.",memory_and_identity,"Basquiat, through his fragmented imagery and text, explores themes of memory, identity, particularly focusing on Black identity and cultural heritage in a predominantly white art world. In 'Venus', he blends personal and historical narratives, referencing African diaspora, mythology, and music.","Throughout his career, Basquiat consistently addressed these themes, evolving from graffiti art to neo-expressionism. His work was initially met with both fascination and controversy, challenging established art historical narratives and gaining recognition from major galleries and institutions.","As a Black American artist of Puerto Rican and Haitian descent, Basquiat's experiences of racism and marginalization deeply influenced his work.  His art became a powerful platform for reclaiming Black identity and challenging societal structures.","His painting 'Irony of Negro Policeman' (1981) depicts a Black police figure trapped within a system of oppression, symbolizing the complexities of Black identity within societal structures.

29,Gagosian Gallery,Anna Weyant: Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolves?,08/10/2024,Anna Weyant,Canada,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolves?, Anna Weyant’s first exhibition in London, opening at the gallery at Davies Street on October 8, 2024. In her new paintings, Weyant infuses elements of autobiography with the symbolic wit, portentous mood, and refined technique that distinguished Baby, It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over, her 2022 Gagosian debut in New York, and The Guitar Man, her 2023 debut in Paris.

Weyant’s precisely rendered figure paintings and portraits undercut their subjects’ attempts at composure with gestures of tragicomic awkwardness, while her crystalline still-life compositions lend everyday objects a similarly unsettling and oneiric tinge, their muted palette contributing a reflective ambience. The six new paintings that comprise Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolves? retain this mood in atmospheric scenarios of distance and isolation.",memory_and_identity,"Based on the exhibition title ""Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolves?"", Weyant's work likely explores themes of fear, vulnerability, and perhaps power dynamics, possibly relating to feminine identity and societal expectations.  However, without more information, it's difficult to say definitively.",I cannot provide a detailed analysis of Weyant's career trajectory and reception without access to external resources.

30,Gagosian Gallery,Jonas Wood,07/10/2024,Jonas Wood,United States,,perception_and_experience,"Jonas Wood aims to convey the vibrancy and unique perspective of everyday life, often focusing on the psychological impact of interior spaces and the emotional resonance of portraits and still lifes. His work explores how we perceive and experience the world around us, particularly through the lens of personal relationships and domesticity.","Throughout his career, Wood has consistently explored themes of perception and experience through his distinctive painting style, characterized by flattened perspectives, bold colors, and intricate patterns.  He has been well-received by galleries and institutions, with exhibitions at prominent venues like Gagosian Gallery and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. His work has garnered critical acclaim for its ability to capture the complexities of human experience in a visually arresting manner.","Wood's motivation likely stems from his personal experiences and observations, as well as his background in psychology.  His upbringing in Boston and his current residence in Los Angeles may also influence his artistic perspective, shaping his understanding of domestic spaces and the interplay between personal and public life.","An example of Wood's work demonstrating this theme is 'Japanese Garden (After Hockney)' (2017). This painting depicts a lush garden scene, rendered in Wood's signature style. The flattened perspective and vibrant colors create a sense of heightened perception, inviting the viewer to experience the garden through Wood's unique artistic lens. The work's title also acknowledges the influence of David Hockney, another artist known for his explorations of perception and experience in landscape painting."
31,Gagosian Gallery,Spencer Sweeney,13/09/2024,Spencer Sweeney,United States,,perception_and_experience,"Spencer Sweeney's work often explores the subjective experience of reality, particularly through the lens of altered states of consciousness, nightlife, and the sensory overload of urban environments. His paintings, sculptures, and installations frequently depict distorted figures, vibrant colors, and fragmented imagery, reflecting a dreamlike or hallucinatory state. He seems to convey the intensity and immediacy of experience, often blurring the boundaries between figuration and abstraction.","Throughout his career, Sweeney has consistently explored themes of perception and experience, often drawing inspiration from his own life and the vibrant downtown New York art scene. His early work was characterized by a raw, expressionistic style, while later pieces incorporate more geometric abstraction and collage elements. He has been embraced by prominent galleries like Gagosian, indicating a strong reception within the art world.  However, critical responses have varied, with some praising his energetic style and others finding his work derivative or superficial.","Sweeney's focus on perception and experience likely stems from his personal immersion in the New York City nightlife and art scene.  His work can be seen as a reflection of his own subjective experiences and observations, filtered through a lens of artistic experimentation. His American nationality and his position within a specific cultural context likely influence his artistic choices and the themes he explores.","One example of Sweeney's work that demonstrates his exploration of perception is ""The Day After"" (2018). This large-scale painting depicts a chaotic scene of distorted figures and objects, rendered in a vibrant, almost psychedelic palette. The fragmented imagery and distorted perspectives create a sense of disorientation and sensory overload, mimicking the feeling of an altered state of consciousness or the aftereffects of a night out. The painting's title further suggests a temporal disjunction, blurring the boundaries between past, present, and future experience. The work's large scale and dynamic composition further enhance the immersive and visceral impact on the viewer's perception."

He aims to re-contextualize historical narratives and challenge conventional representations of power and identity.","Throughout his career, Kaphar has consistently engaged with historical painting, often manipulating or obscuring existing canvases to reveal hidden or suppressed narratives. His work has been featured in major museums and galleries, including MoMA PS1, the National Portrait Gallery, and the Studio Museum in Harlem. His innovative approach to historical representation has garnered critical acclaim and sparked important conversations about race, representation, and the power of art to reshape our understanding of the past.","As a Black American artist, Kaphar's personal experiences and his awareness of the systemic erasure of Black history have deeply influenced his work.  His art serves as a form of historical correction and a powerful commentary on the ongoing struggle for racial justice in the United States.","{'artwork_title': 'Behind the Myth of Benevolence', 'explanation': ""In this work, Kaphar reworks a traditional portrait of Thomas Jefferson, partially obscuring the figure with a draped canvas. This act of veiling both acknowledges Jefferson's historical significance and simultaneously reveals the hidden history of slavery upon which his legacy was built.  The obscured image compels viewers to confront the uncomfortable truths that often lie beneath romanticized historical narratives.""}"
33,Gagosian Gallery,Henry Moore and Greece,12/09/2024,Henry Moore,United Kingdom,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Henry Moore and Greece, organized in collaboration with the Henry Moore Foundation. Opening September 12, it is the first exhibition of the artist’s work in Greece in twenty years. Featuring a selection of work spanning Moore’s career, it illuminates the artist’s fascination with ancient Greek art, which he developed during a trip to Greece in 1951—a few months before his first retrospective at the Tate, London.

In his early stone and wood carvings, Moore had turned away from classical tradition, deriving inspiration mostly from non-European cultures—for example, African and Mesoamerican art. It was not until the early 1950s, and especially following his 1951 visit to Greece, that his attention became increasingly drawn to Greek art. Modeling in clay or plaster and casting in bronze allowed him to work on a larger scale and to incorporate a greater sense of movement in his sculptures. Fragmentary figures—increasingly male and designed to be seen in the round—show more varied surface treatments than those of his earlier work and often incorporate clinging drapery.",memory_and_identity,"Henry Moore, through his engagement with ancient Greek sculpture, sought to convey the enduring power of classical forms and their continued relevance to modern art. He aimed to demonstrate how these ancient forms could be reinterpreted and reimagined to express contemporary concerns and sensibilities, bridging the gap between past and present.","Throughout his career, Moore consistently engaged with the theme of cultural heritage, drawing inspiration from various sources, including prehistoric art, non-Western sculpture, and importantly, ancient Greek art.  His exploration of these influences is evident in his signature reclining figures, which often echo the idealized forms of Greek statuary. His work was widely embraced by major galleries and institutions, solidifying his position as a leading figure in 20th-century sculpture.  His public sculptures, often placed in prominent locations, further emphasized the accessibility and enduring appeal of his interpretations of classical forms.","Moore's fascination with ancient Greek art likely stemmed from a combination of factors, including his British upbringing in a society deeply influenced by classical traditions, his formal art education, and his personal experiences during wartime, which heightened his awareness of the fragility of human civilization and the importance of cultural preservation. His focus on the human form, often depicted in states of vulnerability or resilience, reflected the anxieties and hopes of his time.","Moore's 'Reclining Figure' series exemplifies his engagement with Greek sculptural heritage.  These works, often featuring abstracted female figures in repose, evoke the idealized forms of ancient Greek korai while simultaneously expressing a modern sensibility. The smooth, flowing lines and monumental scale of these sculptures create a sense of timelessness, connecting the viewer to a long artistic tradition while also inviting contemplation on contemporary themes of the human condition.  The abstracted forms allow for open interpretation, encouraging viewers to engage with the work on a personal and emotional level."
34,Gagosian Gallery,Nan Goldin: You Never Did Anything Wrong,12/09/2024,Nan Goldin,United States,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Nan Goldin: You never did anything wrong at 522 West 21st Street, New York. Opening on September 12, the exhibition consists of two new moving-image works presented in specially designed pavilions and an extensive body of new photographs. This is Goldin’s first exhibition of new work since joining Gagosian in 2023.

Stendhal Syndrome (2024) is a moving-image work that juxtaposes photographs Goldin has taken over the last twenty years of Classical, Renaissance, and Baroque masterpieces with portraits of her own friends, family, and lovers. Photographs of paintings and sculptures from museums around the world including the Galleria Borghese, Louvre, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Prado flow seamlessly with images of Goldin’s community, crossing centuries to resonate in harmony with each other, revealing uncanny resemblances in composition, color, form, and emotional tone. Goldin’s ability to draw such precise visual connections raises profound questions about traditional hierarchies within art, and the enduring human compulsion to memorialize beauty in works fueled by love, and grief.

You never did anything wrong, Part 1 (2024) is a home movie centered around the totality of the solar eclipse, filmed in Super 8 and 16mm. The soundtrack includes a mournful piece by Valerij Fedorenko, a chilling new score composed by Mica Levi, and ambient sounds of nature recorded during the eclipse. It is Goldin’s first abstract work, born from an ancient myth that an eclipse is caused by animals stealing the sun.",memory_and_identity,"Nan Goldin's work, often deeply personal and autobiographical, explores themes of love, loss, addiction, and the LGBTQ+ experience. Her photographs and slideshows document her life and the lives of her friends and community, offering intimate portrayals of subcultures and marginalized communities. Through her art, she aims to preserve memories, challenge societal norms, and give voice to those often overlooked.","Throughout her career, Goldin has consistently used photography and slideshows as her primary mediums. Her work has been exhibited in major galleries and museums worldwide, garnering both critical acclaim and controversy. Her unflinching depictions of drug use and the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s and 90s sparked dialogue and brought much-needed attention to these issues.  Her work has been instrumental in shaping contemporary documentary photography and influencing how personal narratives are represented in art.","Goldin's personal experiences, particularly her sister's suicide and her own struggles with addiction, heavily influence her work. As an American artist who has lived and worked internationally, her art reflects a global perspective on identity and community. Her advocacy for social justice and her commitment to representing marginalized communities are central to her artistic practice.","One example of her work is *The Ballad of Sexual Dependency* (1986), a slideshow of nearly 700 photographs set to music. This deeply personal work documents the complexities of love, relationships, and addiction within her circle of friends in the 1970s and 80s.  It captures moments of intimacy, vulnerability, and despair, creating a powerful narrative about the lives of those on the fringes of society. The slideshow's non-linear structure and intimate nature challenge traditional notions of documentary photography and offer a raw and honest portrayal of human experience."
35,Gagosian Gallery,Mark Grotjahn: Out of Country,10/09/2024,Mark Grotjahn,United States,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Out of Country, an exhibition of new and recent paintings by Mark Grotjahn at the gallery’s 980 Madison Avenue location in New York. Opening on September 10, Out of Country represents the culmination of the Backcountry series that has occupied the artist since 2021, and features never before exhibited paintings on white grounds, as well as two black-ground paintings. A press preview and tour with the artist will take place at 10:30am on Monday, September 9.

In his paintings, sculptures, and works on paper, Grotjahn investigates color, perspective, seriality, and the sublime. The concluding entries in the Backcountry series featured in this exhibition see him again draw inspiration from the experience of rural American landscapes, specifically those from his ski and fly-fishing tours in the remote backcountry of western Colorado. While the works contain an element of pictorial representation, hinting at a snowy mountain descent or starlit nocturnal pass, their primary commitment is still to abstraction, specifically the nuanced layering of line, tone, and texture. Continuing to produce variations on an identifiable style and format, Grotjahn builds on a dynamic rhythm that transcends simple visual record to achieve a unique formal and emotional complexity.",perception_and_experience,"Mark Grotjahn's abstract paintings, particularly his 'Butterfly' series and his perspective-bending face paintings, explore the interplay of color, form, and perception. He aims to create a visceral visual experience that challenges viewers' understanding of space and depth, often inducing optical illusions and a sense of movement. His recent 'Out of Country' exhibition likely continues this exploration, focusing on how color and geometric arrangements can evoke powerful sensory responses.","Grotjahn initially gained recognition for his abstract paintings featuring colorful, converging lines and geometric patterns.  His 'Butterfly' series became particularly well-known for its dynamic compositions and use of perspective. He later expanded his practice to include large-scale face paintings, further pushing the boundaries of perception and representation.  While often associated with abstract expressionism, Grotjahn's work also draws on elements of op art and minimalism. He has been consistently exhibited in major galleries and museums worldwide, including Gagosian Gallery, the Museum of Modern Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. His work has generally been well-received by critics, who praise his technical skill and ability to create visually arresting and thought-provoking images.","As an American artist living and working in Los Angeles, Grotjahn's artistic motivations likely stem from a combination of personal experiences and the broader cultural landscape.  His interest in perspective and visual perception may be influenced by the city's sprawling urban environment and the cinematic traditions of Southern California.  His exploration of abstract forms could also be seen as a reflection of the ongoing dialogue between representation and abstraction in contemporary art.","A prime example of Grotjahn's exploration of perception is his 'Untitled (Butterfly #851)' (2011). This large-scale painting features vibrant colors radiating outwards from a central axis, creating a dynamic sense of movement and depth. The converging lines and shifting perspectives challenge the viewer's perception of space and create an almost hypnotic visual effect.  This artwork exemplifies Grotjahn's ability to use abstract forms and color to evoke a powerful sensory experience, prompting viewers to actively engage with the painting's visual complexities."

Her use of color and form can be seen as a visual language for expressing complex inner states.  She is a well-established artist represented by Gagosian, a prominent gallery, indicating significant recognition within the art world.","The exhibition's title, 'The Grief Paintings,' suggests a personal motivation for Marden.  As an American artist, her work is likely influenced by the cultural context of how grief and loss are processed in the United States. Further biographical information would be needed to understand specific personal circumstances that might have inspired this series.","Unfortunately, I don't have access to images of specific artworks.  However, imagine a large canvas with layers of muted blues and greys, punctuated by occasional streaks of brighter color. The forms are abstract, yet suggestive of landscapes or figures, creating a sense of both emptiness and resilience. This hypothetical painting could exemplify how Marden might visually represent the complex emotions of grief."
