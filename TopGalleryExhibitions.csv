MOMA,Rosa Barba: The Ocean of One's Pause,03/05/2025,Rosa Barba,Germany,"For Rosa Barba, cinema “allows time and space to vibrate, collapse, overlap, and extend.” Barba’s work often explores natural landscapes and human-made changes to the environment by delving into historical records, personal narratives, and the sensory experience of film. This installation brings together 15 years of Barba’s work, featuring film, kinetic sculpture, and sound. A newly commissioned 35mm film, Charge, forms the core of the installation and examines light as a source of ecological change and scientific innovation.

Accompanying these works is a series of live performances that will culminate in a presentation of White Museum, in which a stream of clear or “white” film will project from the Kravis Studio’s 53rd Street window onto the adjacent public plaza. White Museum transforms the exhibition space into a projection booth, the Museum into a cinematic device, and the plaza into a three-dimensional screen visible from within the building and from the street."
MOMA,Nour Mobarak: Dafne Phono,26/10/2024,Nour Mobarak,Lebanon,"For her first museum exhibition in New York City, Lebanese American artist Nour Mobarak presents a large-scale installation reinterpreting the first opera, La Dafne, which was staged by Jacopo Peri and Ottavio Rinuccini in 1598 and inspired by Ovid’s myth of Apollo and Daphne. In Mobarak’s reimagining of La Dafne, 15 singing sculptures—encasing a multichannel sound installation within mycelium structures—recount the tale in some of the world’s most phonetically complex languages.

Building on histories of avant-garde sound, Mobarak’s most ambitious work to date draws on a longstanding interest in mechanized voice and memory across her practice, which ranges from sculpture to performance, moving image, poetry, and music. In Dafne Phono, Mobarak draws analogies between linguistic structure and the biological processes of mycelium, exploring how both are governed by systems of repetition, decomposition, and regeneration, and relate to wider forces of political power. Bringing new perspectives to a key antecedent in the history of performance, Dafne Phono joins nature and technology in an exploration of the voice’s ability to endure cycles of life and death, bridging histories both ancient and present."
MOMA,Otobong Nkanga: Cadence,10/10/2024,Otobong Nkanga,Nigeria,"The Museum of Modern Art announces ‘Otobong Nkanga: Cadence’, a new, site-specific commission by the Nigerian-Belgian artist Otobong Nkanga (b. 1974) opening in the Donald and Catherine Marron Family Atrium on October 10, 2024. The large-scale installation, which will be on view through June 8, 2025, will feature an all-encompassing environment of sculpture, sound, and text that addresses the rhythms of both ecological life cycles and social upheaval. Central to the commission is a monumental tapestry that will be suspended along the highest wall of the Atrium. Hanging sculptures composed of dyed ropes, interwoven with hand-blown glass and ceramic forms, will be suspended floor-to-ceiling within the space and featured alongside ceramic tablets imprinted with poems written by the artist, and an immersive sound work created by the artist. ‘Otobong Nkanga: Cadence’ is organized by Michelle Kuo, Chief Curator at Large and Publisher, with Elizabeth Wickham, Curatorial Assistant, Department of Painting and Sculpture.

“Otobong Nkanga has changed the way we understand the Earth and our place in it. Her art confronts both the beauty and the degradation of the natural world—and its upheaval in the wake of industrial revolutions, resource extraction, and war,” said Michelle Kuo. “Weaving together intricate materials, images, and sounds, her monumental installation creates new ways of perceiving—and feeling—the massive shifts taking place in our world with heart, poetry, and wonder. We are thrilled to feature the work of an artist who uniquely connects global communities and landscapes.”"
MOMA,Life Dances On. Robert Frank in Dialogue,15/09/2024,Robert Frank,Switzerland,"“I think of myself, standing in a world that is never standing still,” the artist Robert Frank once wrote. “I’m still in there fighting, alive because I believe in what I’m trying to do now.” Life Dances On: Robert Frank in Dialogue—the artist’s first solo exhibition at MoMA—provides a new perspective on his expansive body of work by exploring the six vibrant decades of Frank’s career following the 1958 publication of his landmark photobook, The Americans.

Coinciding with the centennial of Frank’s birth, the exhibition will explore his restless experimentation across mediums including photography, film, and books, as well as his dialogues with other artists and his communities. It will include some 200 works made over 60 years until the artist’s death in 2019, many drawn from MoMA’s extensive collection, as well as materials that have never before been exhibited.

The exhibition borrows its title from Frank’s poignant 1980 film, in which the artist reflects on the individuals who have shaped his outlook. Like much of his work, the film is set in New York City and Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, where he and his wife, the artist June Leaf, moved in 1969. In the film, Leaf looks at the camera and asks Frank, “Why do you make these pictures?” In an introduction to the film’s screening, he answered: “Because I am alive.”"
MOMA,Alex Katz: Seasons,04/07/2024,"	Alex Katz",United States,"The four monumental paintings featured in Alex Katz: Seasons chronicle the changing of the seasons, from the vibrant colors of spring, summer, and fall to the stark palette of winter. These works belong to a new suite of more than 100 paintings created by Alex Katz in his New York studio since 2022. The artist draws inspiration from his immediate surroundings, whether a lone tree encountered on Houston Street on the way home from the cinema, or the lush landscape of Maine, where Katz has spent his summers since 1954. “The sensation of color is what I wanted,” he says. “It’s the sensation of seeing.”

Alex Katz: Seasons celebrates the artist’s ever-evolving approach to interpreting the natural world. He often begins with photographs, taken with an iPhone, and smaller painted sketches, which he transforms into large-scale compositions. In many instances, Katz removes the horizon; its absence, paired with the paintings’ large scale, creates an environment with no clear beginning or end. Katz frequently completes an entire painting in a single morning. Despite continuously revisiting and reworking the four seasons theme, he approaches each canvas as a new venture. Katz cheerfully describes his process as, “Hold your breath and hope for the best.”"
MOMA,LaToya Ruby Frazier: Monuments of Solidarity,12/05/2024,LaToya Ruby Frazier,United States,"“It is incumbent upon me to resist—one photograph at a time, one photo essay at a time, one body of work at a time, one book at a time, one workers’ monument at a time—historical erasure and amnesia,” says artist-activist LaToya Ruby Frazier. Born in 1982 in the steel manufacturing town of Braddock, Pennsylvania, Frazier has used photography, text, moving images, and performance to revive and preserve forgotten stories of labor, gender, and race in the postindustrial era. LaToya Ruby Frazier: Monuments of Solidarity surveys the full range of the artist’s practice, highlighting her role as a social advocate and connector of the cultural and working classes in the 21st century.

For this exhibition, Frazier has reimagined her diverse bodies of work as a sequence of original installations that she calls “monuments for workers’ thoughts,” which address the harmful effects of industrialization and deindustrialization, the healthcare inequities facing Black working-class communities in the Rust Belt, the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and the impact of the closure of a General Motors plant in Lordstown, Ohio. Monuments for Solidarity celebrates the expressions of creativity, mutual support, and intergenerational collaboration that persist in light of these denials of fundamental labor, human, and civil rights. As a form of Black feminist world-building, these nontraditional “monuments'' demand recognition of the crucial role that women and people of color have played and continue to play in histories of labor and the working class."
Tate Modern,Emily Kam Kngwarray,10/07/2025,Emily Kam Kngwarreye,Australia,"Renowned Australian artist Emily Kam Kngwarray created compelling, powerful works that reflect her extraordinary life as a senior Anmatyerre woman from the Utopia region of Australia.

One of the world’s most significant painters to emerge in the late 20th century, her lived experience and spiritual engagement with her homelands was translated into vibrant batiks and later into monumental paintings on canvas. Discover rich textiles, paintings, film and audio elements that embody the majestic scope of Kngwarray’s Country and ancestral heritage.

Kngwarray was in her late 70s when she began painting in earnest. For the next eight years until her death, she painted over 3,000 canvases – roughly one per day – creating timeless art that encapsulates the wisdom, experience and authority she gained throughout her life.

Created in collaboration with the National Gallery of Australia (NGA), this will be the first large-scale presentation of Kngwarray’s work ever held in Europe and a celebration of her astonishing career as one of Australia’s greatest artists.

‘If you close your eyes and imagine the paintings in your mind's eye, you will see them transform. They are real—what Kngwarray painted is alive and true.’ — Jedda Kngwarray Purvis and Josie Petyarr Kunoth, June 2023"

Tate Modern,Leigh Bowery!,27/02/2025,Leigh Bowery,Australia,"Leigh Bowery’s short but extraordinary life left a distinct, undeniable mark on the art world and beyond. An artist, performer, model, TV personality, club promoter, fashion designer and musician, Bowery took on many different roles, all the while refusing to be limited by convention. From his emergence in the nightlife of 1980s London through to his later daring and outrageous performances in galleries, theatres, and the street, Bowery fearlessly forged his own vibrant path. He reimagined clothing and makeup as forms of painting and sculpture, tested the limits of decorum, and celebrated the body as a shape-shifting tool with the power to challenge norms of aesthetics, sexuality and gender. Embracing performance, club culture and fashion design, Bowery created some of the most iconic images of the 1980s and 90s that continue to resonate, with his influence seen in the work of figures such as Alexander McQueen, Jeffrey Gibson, Anohni, and Lady Gaga. This eclectic and immersive exhibition is a rare chance to experience many of Bowery’s ‘Looks’ alongside his collaborations with artists including Michael Clark, Charles Atlas, Nick Knight, Fergus Greer, Stephen Willats, Nicola Rainbird, Mr Pearl, and Lucian Freud. It will provide a fresh insight into the creative scenes in London, New York and beyond featuring Sue Tilley, Princess Julia, Jeffrey Hinton, RuPaul, Les Child, Andrew Logan, Cerith Wyn Evans, Lady Bunny, Trojan, Rachel Auburn, Scarlett Cannon, Lanah P, MINTY and Boy George. Moving from the club to the stage, to the gallery and beyond, step inside Bowery’s dynamic creative world that blurred the lines between art and life."
Tate Modern,Mire Lee,08/10/2024,Mire Lee,South Korea,"Mire Lee will create an exciting new artwork for Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall.
Mire Lee is known for her visceral sculptures which use kinetic, mechanised elements to invoke the tension between soft forms and rigid systems.Using industrial materials such as steel rods, cement, silicone, oil and clay, her work explores the animated nature of these materials as they pour, drip and bulge. Lee’s sculptures have a raw, organic appearance with elements suggestive of living organisms which are combined with machine parts. Motors or pumps channel oozing liquids through them with an unsettling effect. Lee is interested in the power of sculpture to affect both the viewer and the immediate surroundings and is unafraid to push artistic boundaries in spectacular ways. Her atmospheric sculptures and installations engage the senses and create spaces to reflect on themes of emotion and human desire.

Karin Hindsbo, Director of Tate Modern, said: “Mire Lee is one of today’s most intriguing and original contemporary artists and we are delighted she will be creating her first work in the UK here at Tate Modern. Lee produces powerful sculptures, and we look forward to seeing how she transforms the iconic Turbine Hall with her subversive, multi-sensory forms.”
It will also be the first major presentation of Lee’s work in the UK."
Tate Modern,Mike Kelley: Ghost and Spirit,02/10/2024,Mike Kelley,United States,"Discover the elaborate, provocative and imaginary worlds created by experimental artist Mike Kelley.

From the late 1970s to 2012, Kelley made a diverse body of work using drawing, collage, performance, found objects, and video.

Spanning Kelley’s entire career, the exhibition features his breakthrough 'craft' sculptures made from textile and plush toys through to his multi-media installations such as Day Is Done.

Drawing on references from popular and underground culture, literature, and philosophy, Kelley explores how the roles we play in society are entangled with historical fact and imaginary characters from the films and images we consume.

Over a decade since his passing, Kelley’s reflections on identity and memory continue to resonate."
Tate Modern,Anthony McCall,27/06/2024,Anthony McCall,United Kingdom,"In Summer 2024, Tate Modern will present a focused exhibition of immersive works by English-born, US-based artist Anthony McCall. Occupying a space between sculpture, cinema and drawing, McCall is known for his ‘solid-light’ installations that began in 1973 with the seminal work Line Describing a Cone, a key work in Tate’s collection.

In the exhibition, visitors will be able to enter and explore the large-scale sculptural forms which the artist creates from a thin mist and slowly evolving planes of projected light."
Tate Modern,Zanele Muholi,06/06/2024,Zanele Muholi,South Africa,"Zanele Muholi is one of the most acclaimed photographers working today, and their work has been exhibited all over the world. With over 260 photographs, this exhibition presents the full breadth of their career to date.

Muholi describes themself as a visual activist. From the early 2000s, they have documented and celebrated the lives of South Africa’s Black lesbian, gay, trans, queer and intersex communities.

In the early series Only Half the Picture, Muholi captures moments of love and intimacy as well as intense images alluding to traumatic events – despite the equality promised by South Africa’s 1996 constitution, its LGBTQIA+ community remains a target for violence and prejudice.

In Faces and Phases each participant looks directly at the camera, challenging the viewer to hold their gaze. These images and the accompanying testimonies form a growing archive of a community of people who are risking their lives by living authentically in the face of oppression and discrimination.

Other key series of works, include Brave Beauties, which celebrates empowered non-binary people and trans women, many of whom have won Miss Gay Beauty pageants, and Being, a series of tender images of couples which challenge stereotypes and taboos.

Muholi turns the camera on themself in the ongoing series Somnyama Ngonyama – translated as ‘Hail the Dark Lioness’. These powerful and reflective images explore themes including labour, racism, Eurocentrism and sexual politics.​

The exhibition is based on the artist’s 2020-21 exhibition at Tate Modern and will include new works produced since then."

Gagosian Gallery,Cy Twombly,23/01/2025,Cy Twombly,United States,"Gagosian is pleased to announce an exhibition of paintings, a sculpture, and works on paper by Cy Twombly. The presentation opens on January 23, 2025, across two floors of the galleries at 980 Madison Avenue. Organized in association with the Cy Twombly Foundation, it includes key bodies of work from 1968 through 1990, including pieces that have never been shown before and loans from the Twombly family.

The installation on the sixth floor features a series of paintings that Twombly made from 1968 through 1971, representing a more austere approach than do the canvases of the prior decade. Produced during the era of Minimalism and Conceptual art, these canvases have often been interpreted as “blackboards”—their gestural flux breaking down distinctions between painting, drawing, and writing.

One work from 1968 features nested loops that cascade down and across the canvas. Inscriptions and numbers give the work a diagrammatic quality, while its dynamic composition recalls Leonardo da Vinci’s Deluge drawings (c. 1517–18). An untitled painting of nine panels from 1971 forms a sequence linked by accumulated diagonals and curves.

The installation on the fifth floor includes a series of verdant green paintings that Twombly made in Bassano in Teverina, Italy, from 1981 through 1986. Marking the artist’s exploration of color and the liquidity of paint, these layered, atmospheric works abstract elemental meetings of water, earth, and air. A group of these paintings is rendered on barbed quatrefoil panels, their format, palette, and evocation of landscapes echoing Rococo art.

Condottiero Testa di Cozzo (1987) refers to Titian’s portrait of the Grand Duke of Alba (c. 1570) with vibrant passages that paraphrase the Renaissance commander’s red sash, ruffled collar, and black armor. Twombly’s emblematic treatment of natural forms is furthered in a series of vibrant floral abstractions from the Souvenir of D’Arros series (1990), while a sculpture from 1983 exemplifies his engagement with materiality and gesture in three dimensions.

Five Day Wait at Jiayuguan (1980) is a suite of works on paper first exhibited at the 39th Biennale di Venezia and publicly reunited here for the first time in over forty years. Made in Rome, it was inspired by Twombly’s travels the previous year through Russia, Afghanistan, and Central Asia, and is titled after the city in northwestern China, on the edge of the Gobi Desert. Through gestural forms and poetic inscriptions, these works evoke observations of life, history, and culture in the desert landscape.

The exhibition is accompanied by two Gagosian publications: an illustrated two-volume catalogue featuring essays by Suzanne Hudson and Jenny Saville, and a facsimile of the artist’s book of Five Day Wait at Jiayuguan, originally published by Gabriele Stocchi in 1981 for the Biennale di Venezia presentation."
Gagosian Gallery,Setsuko: Kingdom of Cats,15/01/2025,Setsuko Klossowska de Rola,Japan,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Kingdom of Cats, an exhibition of works by Setsuko that represents the first time the artist has shown her bronze and ceramic sculptures in New York. The inclusion of paintings, works on paper, and handmade tables and pedestals offers a material overview of the artist’s practice. Opening on January 15, the presentation makes full use of the intimate space at Park & 75, and visitors will also be able to view it from the street.

In her sculptures, Setsuko renders natural subjects with rich, tactile surfaces, uniting organic and constructed elements to represent the symbiosis of life and death. In her gouache and watercolor paintings of still-life and floral arrangements, domestic interiors, and landscapes, she conveys the joy embodied in crafted objects, organic forms, and atmospheric spaces. Combining ancient Eastern traditions with twentieth-century Western ideas, Setsuko interprets the everyday in ways that are at once lyrical and precise.

As the exhibition’s title suggests, cats make repeated appearances in the works on view. The lively creatures, of which Setsuko has owned dozens, have cropped up frequently in the artist’s practice over the years, always conveying a sense of agency and animating the spaces through which they move. Cats are important symbols in Japanese folklore regarded as possessing special abilities; the classification kaibyō (“strange cat”) includes bakeneko, a yōkai or supernatural entity with the ability to shapeshift into human form. Maneki-neko, on the other hand, are usually depicted as waving figurines empowered to bring their owners good luck. Setsuko’s late husband, Balthus, also referred to himself as the “King of Cats.”

In the delicately modeled enameled ceramic and terra-cotta objects on view in New York, which include Le chaton et sa mère (2024), Le chat et l’arbre (2024), L’arbre et la chouette (2023), and Le serpent et la vigne (2024)—all produced at Astier de Villatte’s workshop in Paris—Setsuko represents plants and animals that have made trees their homes. Cats meander around gnarled roots while watchful owls perch in upper branches and snakes wind around imposing trunks. Inspired by Japanese Jōmon earthenware (c. 10,500–300 BCE), Setsuko also evokes the country’s animistic Shinto religion, to which trees are of central significance.

Trees and other plants are also the subjects of Setsuko’s hand-painted bronzes, which include a new large-scale representation of a fig tree with foliage and attendant animals, finished in a dark green patina. In Le chat et la vie (2024), the tree’s circular form embodies the cycle of life, a theme reinforced by the subject’s historical symbolic significance—fig trees are often referenced in antique and religious texts. In two other bronzes, Chandelier (le vigne) (2021) and Grand Chandelier (grenades) (2023), the natural organisms of the works’ titles are refigured as baroque candelabras. The artist also extends her use of terra-cotta in three rectangular palettes shaped from slabs of the material painted with scenes distinguished by a heady mix of classical, natural, and mystical imagery inspired by mythological characters such as Daphne and using color derived from dreams. Setsuko only began employing the highly physical processes necessary to the shaping of bronze and ceramic in 2019; thus, these projects constitute a significant new direction for an artist still eager to experiment with material and form.

The paintings on paper, canvas, and wood in Kingdom of Cats are mostly delicate still-life arrangements and domestic interiors. The earliest, Nature morte avec branches de kumquat, is from around 1960 and the most recent, Bouquet de printemps III, was completed in 2023. Paysage d’Italie (2023) is a landscape study representing the loggia of the artist’s former house at Montecalvello, near Rome. In compositions such as Nature morte avec l’oiseau bleu (2020) and the luminous gouache Nature morte sur tissues indiens (1993), Setsuko invests flattened pictorial spaces with a quiet intimacy, again synthesizing traditional Japanese and modernist European approaches."
Gagosian Gallery,Takashi Murakami,20/12/2024,Takashi Murakami,Japan,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Japanese Art History à la Takashi Murakami, an exhibition of new paintings by Murakami at its Grosvenor Hill gallery in London. In this presentation, the artist pursues his fascination with the narrative of Japanese art by offering his own interpretations of historical paintings. By “Murakamizing” these iconic images, he ponders the erosion of the nation’s ancient splendor; he also considers the ways in which it has been impacted by new aesthetics and values associated with its opening to the West after the end of the Edo period (1603–1868). Rakuchū-Rakugai-zu Byōbu: Iwasa Matabei RIP (2023–24) is modeled on Iwasa Matabei’s Rakuchū-Rakugai-zu Byōbu (Scenes in and around Kyoto) (Funaki Version) from the collection of the Tokyo National Museum. The original seventeenth-century work depicts the city in extraordinary detail across two six-panel folding screens. Murakami’s version, which was commissioned for his exhibition Mononoke Kyoto at the Kyoto City Kyocera Museum of Art, populates its gold-leaf clouds with skulls, a memento mori inspired by a visit to the Toribeno burial ground. He also integrates examples of his own iconography including smiling flower-faced figures and his familiar Mr. DOB character."
Gagosian Gallery,Sarah Crowner: Night for Day,14/11/2024,Sarah Crowner,United States,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Night for Day, an exhibition of new works by Sarah Crowner. Opening on November 14 at the Athens gallery, the exhibition features new paintings and an immersive, site-specific tile installation.

A brilliant yellow hue permeates the gallery’s ground-floor spaces, emanating from a plane of handmade glazed tiles spanning in all directions. Laid in an expansive chevron pattern and set atop a raised wooden platform as if a theatrical stage, Platform (Yellow terra cotta) (2024) is immediately visible from the gallery’s entrance: visitors step onto a bright, earthen surface and into a chromatic environment that replicates the color temperature of the intense Hellenic heat, capturing daylight as one might enter the color field of an abstract painting.

In the upstairs rooms, sewn paintings composed of interlocking curvilinear shapes hang in contrast to the hard heat below. Deep greens and rich blues saturate soft surfaces and recall illuminated foliage of dense gardens or forests at night. Inverting the title of François Truffaut’s 1973 film Day for Night, which was named after the filmmaking technique in which outdoor sequences are filmed in daylight and filtered to appear as if at night, Crowner subtly catalyzes a sequence of light to dark and back again as one travels between gallery floors—a sensory palette that evolves as much between tangible forms as with shifts in natural light throughout the day."
Gagosian Gallery,"Katharina Grosse: Pie Sell, Lee Slip, Eel Lips",12/11/2024,Katharina Grosse,Germany,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Pie Sell, Lee Slip, Eel Lips, an exhibition of new paintings by Katharina Grosse at its gallery at Park & 75, New York. This exhibition follows Katharina Grosse: Studio Paintings, 1988–2022: Returns, Revisions, Inventions, a retrospective that originated at the Mildred Lane Kemper Art Museum in Saint Louis and traveled to the Kunstmuseum Bern and Kunstmuseum Bonn through September 2024.

Grosse uses a compressor-driven spray gun to apply industrial paints directly onto landscapes, architecture, objects, and panels. This tool extends her reach and accelerates her gestures, balancing impulsiveness with intent. In her studio outside Berlin, she produces works on canvas in a practice that is consistent with the spontaneous flow of her improvisational, performative process. Painting in the studio also permits her to develop works over a longer period than the institutional and organizational constraints of her in-situ projects generally allow.

In her studio paintings as much as in her environmental works, Grosse uses paint to claim territory at immersive scales, introducing new conceptions of color and space that disorient and reorient the viewer. To make them, she sprays paint onto unstretched canvases in a varied palette of vibrant primary and secondary hues, making use of chromatic and spatial juxtaposition. The propulsive, rhythmic marks traverse the paintings as tapering lines and whiplash curves that spiral back on themselves, capturing the trajectories of the artist’s full-body movements."
Gagosian Gallery,Jeff Wall,08/11/2024,Jeff Wall,Canada,"Gagosian is pleased to present an exhibition of works by Jeff Wall at the 541 West 24th Street gallery in New York. Included are five new pictures and several not previously seen in the United States.

Wall connects photography with elements of painting, cinema, and literature in pictures that range from classic reportage to elaborate constructions. Some images emphasize what the artist calls “blatant artifice,” while others are made simply, spontaneously, and directly. Wall favors no particular approach and has explored the breadth and complexity of photography for several decades.

A number of works in the exhibition are what Wall calls “near documentary” images, which may resemble snapshots but are made in collaboration with people who appear in them. This group includes two full-length portraits, Young man wet with rain (2011) and Portrait in Noto, which was photographed in 2007 during a visit to Sicily, but printed only this year. Fallen rider, made in summer 2022, derives from an event witnessed by a friend thirty years ago; Wall recovered the memory of this account and reconstructed it near the place where it apparently occurred."
Gagosian Gallery,Sabine Moritz: Frost,08/11/2024,Sabine Moritz,Germany,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Frost, an exhibition of new abstract paintings by Sabine Moritz. This is the artist’s second exhibition with the gallery and her first on the West Coast.

Moritz’s paintings, drawings, and prints envision moments suspended in time. In her earlier work, the artist juxtaposes interpretations of her immediate surroundings and signifiers of the natural world with deconstructed documentary images; in many of her recent canvases, she adopts a more narrative approach, which she augments by using a horizontal format. Continually altering and deploying a wide range of abstract and symbolic motifs, Moritz explores the dynamics of transience and decay in works that locate personal experiences within broadly shared histories.

Since 2015, Moritz has increasingly worked in an abstract mode, creating paintings that she dubs “psychological landscapes,” titled after elements, locations, months, seasons, and mythological entities. In these works, overlapping brushstrokes are allied with chromatic contrasts in improvised compositions. Searching for primal sensory experience, Moritz avoids preliminary sketching, confronting the viewer instead with an unmediated dialogue between color and gesture that addresses recollection and history in a consciously oblique, ambiguous manner.

In the twenty new canvases on view in Beverly Hills, Moritz presents dense arrays of painterly marks that harness the emotional power of color while retaining a consistent visual rhythm. With titles that refer to time and place, and to poetry—And the lovers lie abed, with all their griefs in their arms (D. T.) (2024) is taken from Dylan Thomas’s ars poetica “In My Craft or Sullen Art,” from his 1946 collection Deaths and Entrances—the works repay extended looking. Moritz applies pigment vigorously and in layers, sometimes as impasto, which is then scraped back to imbue the surface with a varied texture. Engineering collisions between shape and hue, she sometimes also suggests figures emerging from or disappearing into the works’ interlocking patterns. This establishes references to artists of different epochs who have integrated the human form into landscape paintings. Like frost, which seems suspended between liquid and solid conditions, Moritz’s figures exist in an enigmatic liminal state."
Gagosian Gallery,Jadé Fadojutimi: Dwelve - A Goosebump in Memory,07/11/2024,Jadé Fadojutimi,United Kingdom,"One question isn’t who am I, but rather where have I been all this time?
—Jadé Fadojutimi

Gagosian is pleased to announce DWELVE: A Goosebump in Memory, Jadé Fadojutimi’s first solo exhibition in New York, at 522 West 21st Street. Featuring new paintings and works on paper, the project bears a title that combines the words dwell and delve, suggesting both domestic familiarity and sites that prompt further discovery.

In her large-scale acrylic and oil canvases, Fadojutimi uses color, space, and line to explore concepts of identity, emotion, and experience. Employing layers and gestural marks, she produces compositions that often suggest plants or landscapes, but which ultimately remain abstract. Each visual “environment” is constructed with strata of paint interrupted by lines of oil pastel and oil bar, the indeterminate contours of which suggest narratives of displacement. Fadojutimi also draws inspiration from animation, clothing, and music."
Gagosian Gallery,Jean-Michel Basquiat: Venus,17/10/2024,Jean-Michel Basquiat,United States,"Venus, morning star, sweet potato, I have the silver and you have the gold.
—Jean-Michel Basquiat

Basquiat saw the world differently. He had a great grasp of the history of art and visual culture and was brilliant at bringing the past to life in his paintings. His work reminds us of the common chords and resonances of beauty and identity throughout art history. Seeing his painting in dialogue with this ancient Venus sculpture reminds us of the enduring energy and sophistication of his work.
—Larry Gagosian

Gagosian is pleased to announce Venus, a pairing of two rarely seen masterpieces from different millennia: Untitled (1982), a significant painting from Jean-Michel Basquiat’s acclaimed Modena series, is shown in dialogue with an Imperial Roman sculpture of the goddess Venus loaned from the Torlonia Collection in Rome, the world’s largest private collection of Roman art. This is Gagosian’s eleventh exhibition dedicated to Basquiat and demonstrates the gallery’s ongoing commitment to the artist’s legacy.

Highlighting how Venus has been a muse across centuries, the exhibition is on view from October 17 at Gagosian’s gallery at 9 rue de Castiglione and offers an uncommon gallery setting for classical and contemporary masterworks in central Paris."

Gagosian Gallery,Anna Weyant: Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolves?,08/10/2024,Anna Weyant,Canada,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolves?, Anna Weyant’s first exhibition in London, opening at the gallery at Davies Street on October 8, 2024. In her new paintings, Weyant infuses elements of autobiography with the symbolic wit, portentous mood, and refined technique that distinguished Baby, It Ain’t Over Till It’s Over, her 2022 Gagosian debut in New York, and The Guitar Man, her 2023 debut in Paris.

Weyant’s precisely rendered figure paintings and portraits undercut their subjects’ attempts at composure with gestures of tragicomic awkwardness, while her crystalline still-life compositions lend everyday objects a similarly unsettling and oneiric tinge, their muted palette contributing a reflective ambience. The six new paintings that comprise Who’s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolves? retain this mood in atmospheric scenarios of distance and isolation."

Gagosian Gallery,Henry Moore and Greece,12/09/2024,Henry Moore,United Kingdom,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Henry Moore and Greece, organized in collaboration with the Henry Moore Foundation. Opening September 12, it is the first exhibition of the artist’s work in Greece in twenty years. Featuring a selection of work spanning Moore’s career, it illuminates the artist’s fascination with ancient Greek art, which he developed during a trip to Greece in 1951—a few months before his first retrospective at the Tate, London.

In his early stone and wood carvings, Moore had turned away from classical tradition, deriving inspiration mostly from non-European cultures—for example, African and Mesoamerican art. It was not until the early 1950s, and especially following his 1951 visit to Greece, that his attention became increasingly drawn to Greek art. Modeling in clay or plaster and casting in bronze allowed him to work on a larger scale and to incorporate a greater sense of movement in his sculptures. Fragmentary figures—increasingly male and designed to be seen in the round—show more varied surface treatments than those of his earlier work and often incorporate clinging drapery."
Gagosian Gallery,Nan Goldin: You Never Did Anything Wrong,12/09/2024,Nan Goldin,United States,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Nan Goldin: You never did anything wrong at 522 West 21st Street, New York. Opening on September 12, the exhibition consists of two new moving-image works presented in specially designed pavilions and an extensive body of new photographs. This is Goldin’s first exhibition of new work since joining Gagosian in 2023.

Stendhal Syndrome (2024) is a moving-image work that juxtaposes photographs Goldin has taken over the last twenty years of Classical, Renaissance, and Baroque masterpieces with portraits of her own friends, family, and lovers. Photographs of paintings and sculptures from museums around the world including the Galleria Borghese, Louvre, Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Prado flow seamlessly with images of Goldin’s community, crossing centuries to resonate in harmony with each other, revealing uncanny resemblances in composition, color, form, and emotional tone. Goldin’s ability to draw such precise visual connections raises profound questions about traditional hierarchies within art, and the enduring human compulsion to memorialize beauty in works fueled by love, and grief.

You never did anything wrong, Part 1 (2024) is a home movie centered around the totality of the solar eclipse, filmed in Super 8 and 16mm. The soundtrack includes a mournful piece by Valerij Fedorenko, a chilling new score composed by Mica Levi, and ambient sounds of nature recorded during the eclipse. It is Goldin’s first abstract work, born from an ancient myth that an eclipse is caused by animals stealing the sun."
Gagosian Gallery,Mark Grotjahn: Out of Country,10/09/2024,Mark Grotjahn,United States,"Gagosian is pleased to announce Out of Country, an exhibition of new and recent paintings by Mark Grotjahn at the gallery’s 980 Madison Avenue location in New York. Opening on September 10, Out of Country represents the culmination of the Backcountry series that has occupied the artist since 2021, and features never before exhibited paintings on white grounds, as well as two black-ground paintings. A press preview and tour with the artist will take place at 10:30am on Monday, September 9.

In his paintings, sculptures, and works on paper, Grotjahn investigates color, perspective, seriality, and the sublime. The concluding entries in the Backcountry series featured in this exhibition see him again draw inspiration from the experience of rural American landscapes, specifically those from his ski and fly-fishing tours in the remote backcountry of western Colorado. While the works contain an element of pictorial representation, hinting at a snowy mountain descent or starlit nocturnal pass, their primary commitment is still to abstraction, specifically the nuanced layering of line, tone, and texture. Continuing to produce variations on an identifiable style and format, Grotjahn builds on a dynamic rhythm that transcends simple visual record to achieve a unique formal and emotional complexity."
Gagosian Gallery,Helen Marden: The Grief Paintings,24/07/2024,Helen Marden,United States,"Gagosian is pleased to announce The Grief Paintings, an exhibition of new paintings by Helen Marden, opening at Park & 75 on July 24, 2024.

Begun in 2023 as Marden cared for her husband, Brice, and made over the months following his passing, the Grief Paintings are intimately scaled abstractions created with resin, powdered pigment, ink, and natural objects. Flowing layers of vivid color and assemblages of feathers, shells, and sea glass extend beyond the paintings’ circular supports. Imbued with the spirit of life, love, and creativity, this body of work takes on new meaning in accord with the poem “Growing Up in America” by Rene Ricard, a longtime friend of the couple."
Fondation Louis Vuitton,Ernest Pignon-Ernest: Je Est Un Autre,31/03/2024,Ernest Pignon Ernest,France,"Since the 1960s and for decades before the emergence of “street art”, Pignon-Ernest was paving an adventurous path, combining technical mastery, existential integrity, and the ability to “poetically inhabit the world”, highlighting the notion of “the foreigner,” a foundational element in his works. Across every continent, Pignon-Ernest explores the destinies of those individuals who break the conventional way or are myths to be revived, creating life-size images in everyday environments in a meaningful way."
Fondation Louis Vuitton,Lu Yang: Doku – the Flow,06/04/2024,Lu Yang,China,"For Open Space #14, LuYang presents Doku - The Flow, a film were we follow the new adventures of DOKU, a character whose name is inspired by the phrase ‘’Dokusho Dokushi’’ meaning in Japanese “We are born alone, and we die alone”.

LuYang is presenting his new film DOKU-The Flow, the second chapter of their ongoing work DOKU. Named after the phrase ‘’Dokusho Dokushi’’ meaning ‘’We are born alone, and we die alone, ‘’ the character DOKU is a digital shell, a virtual human whose digital assets artist has been building for nearly five years, as a reincarnation of himself in a parallel universe - an extension of his soul into the digital realm. Building upon his ongoing interest in the digitization of the human body and mind, Yang’s own body provide the template for this virtual human whose ‘’memories’’ form the core of DOKU’s second narrative film.
DOKU-The Flow draws upon the Buddhist philosophy of Madhyamika, which contends that all phenomena are devoid of ‘’nature’’, ‘’substance’’, and ‘’essence’’. In non-linear sequences of lusciously complex 3D-animation, Yang’s DOKU slips in and oud of various digital skins to surpass conventional reality and arrive at the ultimate truth of emptiness."
Fondation Louis Vuitton,"Ellsworth Kelly: Shapes and Colors, 1949-2015",04/05/2024,Ellsworth Kelly,United States,"To celebrate the centenary of the artist’s birth, “Ellsworth Kelly. Shapes and Colors, 1949-2015” will be the first exhibition in France to offer a broad overview of the work of this significant artist of the second half of the 20th century - both in terms of its chronology and in terms of the media on display. Organized with Glenstone Museum (Potomac, Maryland) and in collaboration with the Ellsworth Kelly Studio, the exhibition brings together more than 100 works: paintings and sculptures as well as drawings, photographs and collages. The exhibition has been supported by loans from international institutions (the Art Institute of Chicago, Kröller-Müller Museum, Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Tate, Whitney Museum) as well as private collections.

Ellsworth Kelly is regarded as one of the most significant American abstract painters and sculptors. His career, which spanned seven decades, was marked by his artistic independence from any school or movement, and by his groundbreaking contributions to 20th century painting and sculpture."
